# UFOs

Module 11

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to further enhance the UFO sightings table data that was generated in the module work. Originally a filter was provided for the date field only. This analysis added in filters for city, state, country and shape.

## Results
Now that code has been created, it is a relatively easy process to obtain the desired results on the webpage. Once the webpage is up, simply type in the preferred parameters and then hit Enter on the keyboard. The results filter automatically and instaneously for all five criteria consecutively.

## Summary

### Webpage Drawback

This webpage, while user friendly, could benefit from having a Clear Filters buttton available. It's not initially clear how the user is to clear their filter results. As it stands now, the user has to go in and delete the filter they typed in from each field and hit Enter once again to "unfilter" the data.

### Additional Recommendations

* Displaying the number of results at the top of the table would be beneficial for the user. To display the unfiltered data with a row count and then have that row count updated after each update to the filters could help the user be confident that their filter is working and to know quickly how many results are yielded.

* While not necessary for usability but would increase the viewability, ensuring that the cities, states and countries are capitalized would present the data in a much more professional manner.
